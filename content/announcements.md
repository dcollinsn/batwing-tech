The Judge Announcements Bot is a new tool, currently in development, to help
make sure people can see the official announcements from the Judge Program -
or from whoever else they choose. It will be an extensible and configurable
framework that's meant to take announcements from any JudgeApps forum or Judge
Blog and send them to any Slack or Discord instance. The goal is to make it so
that anyone who runs a Slack or Discord instance can easily configure it for
their own team.

There's still a lot of work to make this happen, but if you like this idea,
please consider [supporting this work](/support/), [contributing on GitHub](https://github.com/dcollinsn/judge-announcement/),
or giving me your ideas or feedback on the GitHub issue pages.
