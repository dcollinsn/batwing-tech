The Judge Announcements Bot is a new tool, to help make sure people can see the
official announcements from the Judge Program - or from whoever else they
choose. It is be an extensible and configurable framework that's meant to take
announcements from any JudgeApps forum or Judge Blog and send them to any Slack
or Discord instance. The goal is to make it so that anyone who runs a Slack or
Discord instance can easily configure it for their own team.

Currently, we support announcements from most main JudgeApps announcement-type
forums and announcement-type judge Blogs. We also support reminders about
upcoming exemplar deadlines and updates about this project itself. We also
currently support Slack as a destination.

I'm interested in adding support for Discord destinations, as well as for
announcements that are specific to a given region or project. For example, you
might be able to add your region's own blog, or some specific JudgeApps regional
or project form.

There's still a lot of work to make this happen, but if you like this idea,
please consider [supporting this work](/support/), [contributing on
GitHub](https://github.com/dcollinsn/judge-announcement/), or giving me your
ideas or feedback on the GitHub issue pages.
