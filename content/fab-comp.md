This article seeks to summarize the shift in judge compensation over time for
Flesh and Blood events, and particularly, Callings, Pro Tours, and World
Championships. Pull requests with additional data are welcome.

We are calculating comp at two specific levels. First is a floor judge working
for two days. This is intended to represent a minimum compensation level, for an
entry-level judge, working a local event. Second is a lead working for three
days. The duties of a lead role vary per tournament organizer, but a three day
lead represents an experienced judge who likely has to travel in order to attend
an event.

For each type of role, the first column represents the offered compensation in
local currency and booster boxes if applicable, and the second column is
converted to USD at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the event with
booster boxes valued at $50, which is a fair sale price after taxes, shipping,
and payment processing fees.

If travel compensation is guaranteed to a specific position, the lowest
guaranteed rate is included.

If an organizer is known to offer lead compensation only for days in which the
individual is in a lead role, despite their increased experience being a value
to the event on each day, it is assumed that staff member is leading 2 out of 3
days.

[^mon]: Monarch Unlimited boxes worth less than standard value. Subtracted $50
    from the total for each role.
[^2daylead]: Assuming two days at lead rate and one day at floor judge rate, due
    to organizer's standard practice.
[^madrid]: Same rate offered to all judges, appears to assume 3 days.
[^noleadrate]: Same rates offered to lead and floor judges.
[^scgboxes]: Judges also received boxes as compensation, but these boxes were not
    listed on the initial judge solicitation. As the quantity is undocumented,
    and judges could not take this into account when deciding whether to apply,
    the are not currently included here.
