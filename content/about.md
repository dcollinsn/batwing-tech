Batwing Hobbies LLC's owner and sole member is Dan Collins - Level 3 Magic: the
Gathering Judge, consultant, and software developer. I am committed to
providing expert and professional services to a wide range of organizations,
projects, and individuals related to competitive gaming and organized play, and
especially to Magic: the Gathering organized play. This includes officiating at
tournaments as well as providing technical work for affiliated projects.

At tournaments, this includes providing rulings and leading teams of judges to
perform the myriad tasks that are required to run a smooth, fun, and fair event.
Outside of tournaments, this means supporting a number of other projects on a
volunteer basis, including the following:

* [Core Developer for JudgeApps](https://apps.magicjudges.org/)

    Led the implementation of several new features, including Reviews, Exams,
    and Checklists, coordinated the shift from Judge Center to JudgeApps for
    these features and more, and made it possible for more people than ever
    before to access the excellent resources that judges have made available on
    that site.

* [Server Administrator for MagicJudges.org](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/)

    Implemented HTTPS throughout the network, coordinated a move to AWS to bring
    the entire network under the control of active judges, and substantially
    improved system stability and backups.

* [Developer of Judge Announcements](https://github.com/dcollinsn/judge-announcements/)

    Designed, implemented, and am maintaining a project to improve distribution
    of Judge Program announcements to the many local and regional chat rooms
    that judges use.

These various projects and more are voluntary and unpaid, despite their
wide-reaching importance to the Judge Program. I'd appreciate your support,
which makes it possible to continue to divert time and effort to these projects
instead of to events or to my professional life. There are a few ways to do
that, which I describe [elsewhere](/support/), or just use the simple links:
