Batwing Hobbies LLC's owner and sole member is Dan Collins - Level 3 Magic: the
Gathering Judge, Level 2 Flesh and Blood Judge, consultant, and software
developer. I'm based out of New Jersey, but you can probably find me at events
thoughout the United States. I am committed to providing expert and professional
services to a wide range of organizations, projects, and individuals related to
competitive gaming and organized play, and especially to TCG organized play.
This includes officiating at tournaments as well as providing technical work for
affiliated projects.

At tournaments, this includes providing rulings and leading teams of judges to
perform the myriad tasks that are required to run a smooth, fun, and fair event.
Outside of tournaments, this means supporting a number of other projects on a
volunteer basis, including the following:

* [Core Developer for JudgeApps](https://apps.magicjudges.org/)

    Led the implementation of several new features, including Reviews, Exams,
    and Checklists, coordinated the shift from Judge Center to JudgeApps for
    these features and more, and made it possible for more people than ever
    before to access the excellent resources that judges have made available on
    that site.

* [Server Administrator for MagicJudges.org](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/)

    Implemented HTTPS throughout the network, coordinated a move to AWS to bring
    the entire network under the control of active judges, and substantially
    improved system stability and backups.
