The following is a partial list of tools that I maintain and use:

* [GEM to PurpleFox Tampermonkey script](https://github.com/dcollinsn/gem-tampermonkey) - cross-browser way to export results from GEM to clipboard, for PurpleFox importing
* [Melee Tampermonkey scripts](https://github.com/dcollinsn/melee-tampermonkey) - cross-browser scripts to allow for things like auto-refresh of results/registration information, showing the tournament name in more places, and exporting to PurpleFox
* [OBS Round Timer](https://github.com/dcollinsn/obs-round-timer) - fork of an OBS Lua script for a timer, customized for TCG events
