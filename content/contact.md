If you'd like to reach out to me for any matter related to any project I am
involved in, or any event I am supporting, please send an email to
dcollins@batwing.tech.

If you are looking for a Flesh and Blood judge in New Jersey, or for Flesh and
Blood events (like ProQuest events, which require a certified judge) in Eastern
Pennsylvania or the New York City area, feel free to contact me at
dcollins@batwing.tech. Even if I'm not available, I can help you find a nearby
judge who is.

Organizers seeking to pay invoices may make payment to the PayPal account
using the same email address. If you require this LLC's legal name and
taxpayer identification number, reach out via email.
