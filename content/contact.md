If you'd like to reach out to me for any matter related to any project I am
involved in, or any event I am supporting, please send an email to
dcollins@batwing.tech.

If you are looking for a level 2 Flesh and Blood judge in New Jersey, or for
Flesh and Blood events (like ProQuest events, which require at least a level 1
certified FaB judge) in Eastern Pennsylvania or the New York City area, feel
free to contact me at dcollins@batwing.tech. Even if I'm not available, I can
help you find a nearby judge who is.

Organizers seeking to pay invoices may make payment to the PayPal account
using the same email address. If you require this LLC's legal name and
taxpayer identification number, reach out via email.
