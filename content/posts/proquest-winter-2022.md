This is a Tournament Report covering a series of five ProQuests that I judged
during the Winter 2022 season. I'm hoping to document both any interesting rules
and policy questions, as well as the evolution of my judging procedures, over
the course of the three-week season.

## Background

The 2022 Winter ProQuest season came shortly after the release of Everfest,
which significantly shook up the Classic Constructed metagame. A new Bravo
initially emerged as the dominant deck, with Chane, the other Runeblades,
Prism, and Oldhim also picking up some new cards.

Each of these ProQuests is capped at 32 players, meaning we will play 5 rounds
and then cut to Top 8, with the winner receiving an invite to the upcoming Pro
Tour.

## Event Planning

Prior to the event, I made sure each TO was aware of the decklist requirement,
and had the decklist form. I also printed out a few spares and threw them in my
bag just in case.

I also planned to cover a few common items during the opening announcements of
each event:

 - Welcome, tournament level and structure (number of rounds, top 8)
 - Decklists required, raise your hand if you don't have one yet
 - 55 minute rounds, play quickly, play accurately, communicate clearly
 - Can concede during the round, can not concede after time is called, can not
   ask for a concession after decks have been presented
 - Any questions or concerns, call for a judge
 - Report results in GEM, to me if you cannot access GEM
 - If you leave the store, be back when the round is scheduled to end to avoid
   tardiness penalties
 - Collect decklists

## Feb 19 - Philly

My first event was at Redcap's Corner in Philadelphia, PA. With a 1PM start, I
arrived in town shortly after 11 in order to grab lunch before the tournament.
The event easily hit the cap of 32 players, so I projected about 8 hours for the
scheduled 5 rounds + top 8. We had a few players running late due to the
downtown traffic, but (after some announcements from the TO and I, and after
collecting decklists) we were able to get round 1 underway around 1:15.

### Arsenal, Draw, ... Wait!

Within the first few minutes of the tournament I received a call from two
players who seemed to be confused about where they were in the game state.
Player A had stated "Pass priority?", waited a few seconds, and received no
response. They arsenaled and drew, and then the opponent said they wanted to use
Seeds.

This is a fairly routine case of players not moving through the game at the same
speed. I confirmed that Player B had not given any verbal indication that Player
A could start their end phase, and ruled that Player B was free to act in
Player A's action phase. Player A didn't like this - we discussed the topic at
the table and again after the match - and he felt that Player B's silence should
be interpreted as Player A being "good to go" with his end phase.

I pointed a few things out. First, that Player B had just drawn his own hand,
and was probably still thinking about whether he had anything to do on Player
A's turn. Second, that Player A could ask more explicitly if Player B was ready
to proceed, and that clearer communication would help both players stay in sync.
Player A did communicate priority passes more explicitly for the rest of the
game, however, he still clearly wasn't happy with the situation.

### Parable of Humility

With all the Prism in this metagame, it is inevitable that there will be some
mistakes with Spectral Shield math. In Round 2, a player noticed while defending
that on his opponent's previous turn (1 turn cycle ago), he had missed a -1
Power effect from Parable of Humility and accidentally destroyed a Spectral
Shield that should have stayed.

Due to a full turn cycle having passed, there was no fix to this situation, only
warnings to both players.

### Eye of Ophidia

During Round 5, I was asked the sequence of operations when a player activates
Crown of Seeds' ability, pitching Eye of Ophidia. This is a common area for
players to question, due to the trigger event occurring while activating an
ability. In the case of Crown of Seeds, the correct sequence is to first finish
paying all costs for the ability, then resolve Eye's trigger, then resolve Crown's
effect.

### Stalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft

Here's a slightly trickier rules question. Player A attacks with a card with
Phantasm. Player B defends with a 6+ attack card, and with Stalagmite, Bastion
of Isenloft. What happens, and in what order?

### Solution: Stalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft

In this scenario, we have two triggered abilities which will be added to the
stack at the same time in an order chosen by the attacking player. When Phantasm
resolves, it will close the combat chain, however other triggered abilities
waiting to resolve will stay on the stack and will resolve in order. So, the
Frostbite will still be created, it is just a matter of when.

When the Phantasm trigger closes the combat chain, Temper will trigger and
resolve. If the Frostbite trigger is still on the stack at this point, it will
resolve after Temper. So, the legal outcomes are:

- Create Frostbite, then Phantasm closes the chain, then Temper
- Phantasm closes the chain, then Temper, then create Frostbite

Regardless of ordering, the Frostbite token will be created, and the Temper
effect will resolve.
