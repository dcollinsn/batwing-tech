Welcome to Batwing.Tech, my (Dan Collins') website for my business working with
the Magic: the Gathering Judge Program. Turns out, places like banks (hi!) trust
you a lot more if you have a website.

If you'd like to know more about what I do, [see the About page](/about/). If
you're willing to help support my work, [there's a place for that too](/support/).

More content should probably go here.
