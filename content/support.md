I'm part of a number of projects for the Magic: the Gathering Judge Program,
some of which I describe in more detail [on my About page](/about/).

These various projects and more are voluntary and unpaid, despite their
wide-reaching importance to the Judge Program. I'd appreciate your support,
which makes it possible to continue to divert time and effort to these projects
instead of to events or to my professional life. There are a few ways that you
can do that, depending on what you're in to:

* **Help!** I'll never turn down support on these projects, and if you're
  interested in putting your own programming skills to work for the Judge
  Program, I'd love to hear from you. We have the most need for Python and
  Django developers, however you don't need a ton of experience - in fact, many
  coders can easily pick up both through [Django's excellent
  tutorial](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/).
* I've set up a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dcollins_judge) for recurring
  donations, or a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/dcollins) for support on your own
  schedule. If that all seems too complicated,
  [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=E3PRNPJWVZSNL&source=url)
  works just fine too.
* Any income from those sources goes first to my own expenses, and then to cover
  other expenses related to the projects I listed above. Running a website in
  the cloud does have real costs, and the Judge Program doesn't have any
  mechanism to pay for them. Any support through these services will help to
  cover those expenses.
* L2+ judges can also use the [Exemplar Program](https://apps.magicjudges.org/recognitions/)
  to support work that they find important or valuable. Make sure you're using
  your recognitions to thank the people who run the [projects](https://apps.magicjudges.org/projects/)
  that you find helpful. [Need ideas?](https://apps.magicjudges.org/recognitions/search/?creator=Dan+Collins&creator_id=7104)
